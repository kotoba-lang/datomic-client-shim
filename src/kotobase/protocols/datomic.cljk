  "datomic.kotobase.net — a Datomic Client API-SHAPED (NOT wire-compatible)
  HTTP+edn query surface over kotobase (ADR-2607172300, KRP addressing
  contract unaffected — a query result set is not itself a new addressable
  resource kind).

  ============================================================================
  READ THIS FIRST: this is shape-compatible with the Datomic Client API's
  `d/q` request/response shape (`{:query ... :args [...]}` in, a result-set
  `#{[...] ...}` out) — it is explicitly, deliberately NOT wire-compatible
  with proprietary Datomic. There is no single open Datomic wire protocol to
  conform to (the Datomic Client API is HTTP+transit but not an
  independently-specified standard; the Peer/transactor protocol is
  proprietary/undocumented) — this repo does not claim to speak either one.
  It borrows the REQUEST/RESPONSE SHAPE only, because that shape is a
  reasonable, familiar `:find`/`:where` Datalog convention, not because a
  real Datomic client can point at this server. See README.md, first
  paragraph, for the same statement in prose form.
  ============================================================================

  What actually answers the query: `kotoba-lang/kotobase-query`'s
  `kotobase.query.bridge` materializes one or more `kotobase.store/IStore`
  collections into an `arrangement.core` db (in-memory, v0.1 linear
  materialization — see that repo's README for the accepted limitation) and
  `arrangement.datalog/q` evaluates the real `:find`/`:where` Datalog query,
  joins across materialized collections included. This namespace is the HTTP
  surface over that bridge — it does not reimplement query evaluation.

  Endpoint (v0.1, the only one):
    POST /api/query    body: edn `{:query <datalog-query> :args [...]}`
                        200: edn `#{[...] ...}` (the result-set tuples)

  Request/response shape vs. the real Datomic Client API's `d/q` — read
  carefully, this is the crux of \"shape-compatible not wire-compatible\":
    - `:query` — same key, same `:find`/`:where`/`:in`/`:rules` Datalog map
      shape.
    - `:args` — same key name, but DIFFERENT semantics from real Datomic.
      Real Datomic's `:args` vector conventionally starts with a `db`
      value, then one positional value per `:in` binding after `db`. This
      surface has no `db` value to hand over the wire — `ctx` already fixes
      which `kotobase.store` collections are materialized (`:coll-keys`) and
      how visibility is decided (`:visible?`) for every request this deploy
      serves. So here `:args` is threaded directly as `kotobase.query.
      bridge/q`'s `inputs` — positional values for whatever `:in` the query
      declares (no db slot). Omit `:args` (or send `[]`) for a query with no
      `:in` clause.
    - the result is the same kind of value (a set of tuples), edn-encoded
      rather than transit-encoded.
    - there is no db/connection/transact endpoint here at all — this
      surface is READ-ONLY (query only), matching ADR-2607172300's scope
      (the four new repos are query-LANGUAGE surfaces, not write surfaces).

  ctx (extends the `{:store IStore}` shape every kotobase-protocols-family
  handler takes, per ADR-2607171700):
    :store      kotobase.store/IStore (required) — the document store
                `kotobase.query.bridge/materialize` reads from.
    :coll-keys  seq of collection identifiers (required) — the default set
                of `kotobase.store` collections materialized for a request
                that doesn't specify its own `:coll-keys` in the body (see
                below). Comes from THIS deploy's schema, not the client —
                a client cannot materialize collections it wasn't given
                access to by whoever built `ctx`.
    :visible?   (fn [datom]) -> bool, REQUIRED, NOT DEFAULTED. Every datom
                `kotobase.query.bridge/q` considers is `{:s :p :o}` — see
                that repo's README/test suite for the exact shape
                (`(fn [{:keys [s]}] ...)` is the common case, filtering by
                entity). Passed straight through to `bridge/q`/`bridge/
                query`, which themselves refuse to run (arity error) without
                it — this handler adds one more layer of refusal on top: if
                `ctx` has no `:visible?` at all, `handle` throws immediately
                rather than silently falling back to \"see everything\"
                (ADR-2607050500, \"query as first-class effect\" — no
                permissive default anywhere in this call chain).

                v0.1 HONESTY NOTE: a real multi-tenant deploy MUST supply a
                real authorization-derived `:visible?` here (tenant/ACL
                check per datom). This repo ships NO such policy — the only
                predicate defined here, `always-visible?` (below), is
                `(constantly true)` and is appropriate ONLY for a
                single-tenant/trusted deploy where every materialized
                collection is already meant to be fully readable by every
                caller of this endpoint. It exists so a deploy shell has an
                explicit, named, opt-IN choice to reach for — never a
                silent fallback baked into `handle` itself.
    :now        optional ISO string, carried through to the audit event
                only (matches the `{:store :now :apex}` shape
                `kotobase.protocols.s3`/`.atproto` etc. use, even though
                this read-only surface has no `:last-modified` field of its
                own to stamp).

  Audit: this surface has no writes to audit in the
  `kotobase.protocols.s3`/`.atproto` sense (no PUT/DELETE) — so, by
  deliberate choice documented here rather than left as a silent gap, EVERY
  successful query is audited instead, one event per request, on the same
  `:kotobase.protocols/audit` collection those write surfaces use
  (`{:surface :datomic :op :query :coll-keys ... :query ... :args-count ...
  :result-count ...}`). This gives the same observability discipline
  (\"every effect is visible in the audit log\") applied to a read surface: a
  query is a first-class effect too (ADR-2607050500's own title), even
  though it does not mutate `store`. Failed requests (parse error, missing
  `:query`, disallowed method/path) are NOT audited — they never reached
  `kotobase.query.bridge` at all."
